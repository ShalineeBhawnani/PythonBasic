My city is not just the place I live in but an essential part of my identity.
Everyone has fond memories of their city and they always remain a part of a personâ€™s life.

My city for me is a place where I have spent most of my childhood.
It is a place I love and want to be in all my life. It is a place where I belong.

My father has a transferable job and hence we are always on a move. We have changed as many as four cities since my childhood.
I never thought that there would be any one city that I would really be able to call home until I moved to Jaipur.
It has been just two years that we have shifted to this place but it feels like home already.
